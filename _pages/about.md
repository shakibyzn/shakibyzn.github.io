I'm a research assistant at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), advised by Prof. Josef van Genabith.

My current research focuses on **continual Learning** and **parameter-efficient fine-tuning**. Previously, I obtained my master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Saarland University. I also worked as a research assistant (Hiwi) at CISPA under Dr. Lea Sch√∂nherr, and at UKP Lab under Dr. Tilman Beck.
